oauthslack Plugin for DokuWiki
==============================

Slack Service for use with the oAuth Plugin

Create a slack app as described in the [Sign in with Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack#setup).
Your _Redirect URL_ should be the full URL to your `doku.php`, like `https://wiki.example.com/doku.php`.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:oauthslack

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
`lib/plugins/oauthslack/` - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
